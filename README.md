# AdvancedMysql
This repo is about creating functions and complex stored procedures, using variables and parameters, creating triggers and events, using common table expressions, prepared statements, using the JSON data type, emulating full outer join.

This was a project I worked on when learning all rhe above listed advanced MySql toipcs, the project had several tasks each tackling a different topic

TASK 1 
Finding out the average sale price, or cost for a product in 2022 by creating a function FindAverageCost() that returns the average sale price value of all products in a specific year based on the user input.

I will use the Orders table to reference the Costs of Products
Creating the function FindAverageCost()

![create function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106580846/207845308-eda9f824-ba22-4a40-9466-df24a516925d.png)

Then use the function created to find the average cost of the product in the year 2021

I misspeled the word average instead typing avaraga when creating the function, so I will write the function as FindAvaragaCost()

![use function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106580846/207845375-5db4af0c-3c8c-49c1-ae25-e282cd172d65.png)
